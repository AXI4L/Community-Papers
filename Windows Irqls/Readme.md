In this article, we will explain how “Task Priority” and IRQLs work internally in Windows, plus I am providing a poster
explaining the “Interrupt Handling” flow with Pentium 4 and Intel xeon processors. At the end of the paper, before we
start I would like to give a special thanks to Ahmed Bahaa for helping me alot in formatting the paper. Thank you.
